# Health_Risk_Prediction_Project
This repository contains my project "Predicting Personal Health Risks through Integrated Lifestyle Analytics with Machine Learning"


## Overview
This project aims to predict individual health risks based on lifestyle choices and environmental factors. By conducting comprehensive data collection from a diverse demographic, including factors such as age, gender, diet, exercise habits, and environmental conditions, we aim to develop a predictive model that can provide insights into potential health risks for individuals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises approximately 800 records, collected from individuals across different age groups and demographics. It includes various features such as lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and health indicators.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Conducted comprehensive data collection from a diverse demographic to capture lifestyle choices and environmental factors affecting health.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features and engineered new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Training**: Applied various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, to train the predictive model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Selection**: Selected the Random Forest algorithm as it demonstrated the highest accuracy rate of 97.45%.
